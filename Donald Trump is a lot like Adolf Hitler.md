### For context for context: 
I'm addicted to reading Wikipedia. I would spend the whole day in a rabbit hole if I could. Also, lately I'm been practicing forming opinions and expressing it. I think it's good for me.
### For context: 
I just spent a few hours reading on Wikipedia about Nazi Germany, and I couldn't help thinking like "damn, this sounds a lot like MAGA." So I went ahead to write a post.
### A bit of a warning and disclaimer: 
I'm biased, this post is biased, and the materials I present in this post to support my "argument" are also likely biased, and I want you to know that. I spend a lot of time browsing Reddit, and Reddit is left-leaning. Most of the articles I found against Trump I started looking on Reddit. Information I learnt about Nazism and by extension - Hitler, was from Wikipedia, and [Wikipedia articles tends to be slanted towards democratic views.]([Ideological bias on Wikipedia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_bias_on_Wikipedia#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20that%20%22Wikipedia,about%20immigration%20trended%20toward%20Republican.)) 
With that said, what is written in this post is my opinion and mine only, except for some parts that I stole directly from Wikipedia.
### This is a terrible opinion piece and you should stop reading.
Stop wasting your time. You can close this tab now, right here. There's no need to read any further. Press Ctrl+W now to live long and prosper, Command+W if you're on a Macbook. Okay. Now that everyone's stopped reading, I can write whatever I want after this paragraph.

### What I want to say is: Donald Trump and the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement share a lot of similarities with Adolf Hitler and Nazism, and I think that is not good.


### Is Trump racist? Yes.  Is Hitler racist? I think so..?
On account of racism and Hitler, is he racist? Is he? He belongs to the *[master race](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deadly-medicine-creating-the-master-race)* after all.

So what about Trump? The man has been trying to appear not-a-racist for a while now, claiming he's "the least racist person." Well, I'm sorry if you're a Vox hater, but I'll let [this Vox article do the talking]([Trump’s long history of racism, from the 1970s to 2020 - Vox](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history)).
During a rally on Wednesday, Donald repeatedly attacked Kamala, saying "She's totally against the Jewish people." That is new, probably because Kamala's husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. 
I have a hard time determining who is racist here. Is it Kamala or Donald?

### On the delicate topic of religion, many Republicans want to declare the U.S. a Christian nation.
#### State religion
From what I managed to gather, Hitler attempted to create a unified [Protestant Reich Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Evangelical_Church) what would be compatible with Nazi ideology for all of Nazi Germany. It is just as bad as it sounds.

I can't understand why [many Republicans support declaring the U.S. a Christian nation](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/09/21/most-republicans-support-declaring-the-united-states-a-christian-nation-00057736), but I'm well aware that religious pluralism has long been a thing in the nation. Such a declaration would likely foster the creation of a state church, and many problems that follows including religious conflicts, similar to what happened in Germany.

Josh Hawley - Missouri Republican Senator - even [used fake Patrick Henry quote to push religious agenda](https://x.com/MoDemParty/status/1676610593459937283), and [was called out for it](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/josh-hawley-fake-quote_n_64a4f94be4b028e64733b057?d_id=6029700&ncid_tag=tweetlnkushpmg00000067&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=us_main).

#### A messiah, the Chosen One
Nazi propaganda stylised Hitler as a Christ-like messiah, a "figure of redemption according to the Christian model", "who would liberate the world from the Antichrist" (see [Toward the Millennium Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco (p.311)](https://books.google.com.gi/books?id=4t_QAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false))

After the 13th July assassination attempt on Trump, [many are heralding him as the Chosen One](https://international.la-croix.com/world/donald-trump-becomes-the-chosen-one-for-american-evangelicals).
This image started floating around a lot on Facebook and Twitter after the shooting:

#### Approaching a cult of personality.
A prominent feature of Nazi Germany is [Adolf Hitler's cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_cult_of_personality) To quote Wikipedia again (which I should really step away one day and try to reach more primary sources): "The Hitler myth of an infallible multi-faceted genius with messianic and superhuman qualities approached [deification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deification "Deification"). It was weaponized as a tool to unify the German people behind the personality, opinions, and goals of Hitler and was also insurance against the [Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party "Nazi Party") fragmenting into warring factions or a [coup d'etat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27etat "Coup d'etat") by the [Wehrmacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht "Wehrmacht")."

So what's happening in the *[free world](https://inkstickmedia.com/the-myth-of-the-free-world/)* right now?

### Life unworthy of life.
To quote Wikipedia: "The phrase "**life unworthy of life**" ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): _Lebensunwertes Leben_) was a [Nazi designation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_term "Nazi term") for the segments of the populace which, according to the Nazi regime, had no [right to live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life "Right to life"). Those individuals were targeted to be murdered by the state ("[euthanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_euthanasia "Involuntary euthanasia")"), usually through the compulsion or deception of their caretakers. The term included people with serious medical problems and those considered grossly inferior according to the [racial policy of Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany "Racial policy of Nazi Germany"). This concept formed an important component of the [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology") of [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") and eventually helped lead to [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust "The Holocaust").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_unworthy_of_life#cite_note-Lifton-1)"
In short, those who are deemed "unworthy of life" included disabled people, and they were set to be murdered.

What about Trump? This [TIME article](https://time.com/7002003/donald-trump-disabled-americans-all-in-the-family/) reports, that Trump told his nephew that his disabled son should just die. 
At this point I stopped looking for more info. I can't read such things no more. It hurts me.

### Why am I writing this poor opinion post?
It saddens me to see the people I love make uninformed judgements about such an enormously important event as the 2024 U.S. presidential election, so I seek to bring some of my (clearly biased) opinion backed by fairly reliable information I found to help them balance their views.

This event will have an impact on all of us, whether we want or care about it or not, given the sheer influence the United States has on the world. Then we have FUV, at which I'm still an undergrad student, so it will certainly affect me and my peers. That is why I care about this topic.

### I may very well be wrong.
This post is of poor quality, I'm well aware. It's nothing more than excerpts from Wikipedia and a handful of articles barely botched together to form a faintly (and hopefully) coherent message. It's my first time doing it, and it's also my first time expressing my political opinions. I may very well be wrong on all of this, and I would love to be told so, because that would help me learn more.

You may disagree with what I wrote. If you do, please educate me with what you think about it, I'm open to learn more. I'm not being sarcastic.
