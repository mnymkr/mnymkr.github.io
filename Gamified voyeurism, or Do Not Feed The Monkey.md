## Spying on strangers from around the world, anyone?

I recently discovered a website called [insecam.org](http://www.insecam.org) that streams footage from unsecured cameras from around the world. You can go on this website to look at the world in its most usual state: boring. What appears most of the time would be grainy, empty, motionless objects, and the only reminder that this is not a static image is a ticking timestamp.

Occasionally I did find a feed with people going about their lives, and watching this gave me a tranquilising, almost serene chill, but creepily so. It's as if I'm a ghost observing these people without actually existing in their surroundings.

Is it illegal? Yes, please don't tell my mom.

## Try it, you'll see what I mean.

Now if you found the existence of this website ethically unacceptable, but still want to not just observe but join in the action and meddle with people's lives, your second best option would be *Do Not Feed The Monkey*.

## This game is pretty cute

Since I'm a sucker for pixels, this game I found while browsing through Google Play Pass's catalogue immediately caught my attention. You'll be a member of an Illuminati-esque club that has access to hidden cameras and security footage everywhere. You can spy on people through these cameras, chuckle a bit, and then turn off the game and live a long and prosperous life.

Or alternatively, you can learn about their lives, intrude their secrets for personal gains or for the simple joy of destroying someone's life. Well, virtual lives, but it's still fun.

## This game is simple

Do Not Feed The Monkeys is, dare I say, very accessible to the casual audience, and feels right at home on the touch screen. To play the game you simply click on things on the screen with your mouse or touch screen, so no prior gaming experience is needed.

In this game you'll do 2 simple tasks: staying alive, and spying on people.

As a backdrop, you live in a small, dirty apartment in a country still shaken in the remnants of a global war, and run by a 70 year old dictator. Money's constantly running dry, and you'll have to work constantly just to afford food and rent, all the while trying to get enough sleep and not ruin your health with junk food.

If all this sounds boring, that's because *it is*. But save up that sweet dough because there'll be *cages* for purchase, with *primates* inside for you to *observe*.

## This game is pretty fun

You're also a member of a secret club with access to live security cameras or hidden camera footage from many places in the country. This sounds familiar, because that's just *gamified insecam.org*, although made much more interesting now. You can listen for dialogues, study the *cages*, and work out details about the people in the *cages.* What to do with this information is up to you though, that's the part that made the game *fun* for me. I managed to dox a driver, blackmailed someone, saved another, and made a species of deer go completely extinct.

And that was all just harmless fun, because it's a video game. Or if you're any bit into voyeurism, this might keep you interested. 

## Assuming I've got you convinced...

…here's a few tips before you play.

Keep note of the times characters talk, otherwise you'll find yourself looking at blank scenes for hours and get bored fast. 
Also, don't worry too much about your health, a few junk food is fine (**advice works in-game only**).

## Is this an ad?

I won't get paid for it either way, I just think this game may be worthy of your attention and money. Gaming, as a whole, is my hobby. That includes playing video games and talking about it, spreading the word, you might say. I made it my mission to let more people around me know about video games as more than just cheap entertainment junks as many people around me negatively put it. So take this as my motto: *video games can be art, and pretty f\*cking fun.*

If you're not into gaming or have never played video games before, I hope this might be a good introduction to gaming for you to try. And it goes for cheap.
