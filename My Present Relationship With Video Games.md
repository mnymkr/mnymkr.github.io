I yearn for the days when I could open a video game and get lost in it. I seemed to have lost the ability to do so.

Lately I have not been able to enjoy video games. I go into video games because I just want to feel something, anything. Maybe that's because of depression, it deprives me of my feelings, and replaces it with sadness. The more depressed I am, the harder I try to solicit a feeling from playing video games. But it's next to impossible, because I'm so depressed. And so the harder I try to feel something by playing video games, the more depressed I become.

It's a trap. The more I played, the more I am aware of the fact that I am playing by myself, and the more depressed I became. I couldn't play multiplayer games, the sort of League of Legends and PUBG I couldn't wrap my head around. And even if I could, it's difficult to come by a group of friends who are willing to play games with me in the hours I am can play with them - usually in the morning or past midnight.

I found myself going back to a game called The Stanley Parable very often. It's a game wherein the player takes on the role of Stanley, and they interact with the game's narrator in very "meta" ways. I found some sort of pretend connection to The Narrator, to the way he reacts to my actions. I know full well that there's no real human connection here, it's all pre-programmed and will always play out the same way every single time if I repeat the same inputs.

But still, I found a pretend connection better than nothing. I would often boot up the game, do something to make the narrator talk at length, usually in the Broom Closet, then put down the controller, and go do something else while he talks. That's how I got to feel that somebody is talking to me and me only. That's how I managed to fight the loneliness away, temporarily. It's my go-to game whenever I felt like I'm stranded alone on an island thousands of kilometers away from the shores. It's where I looked for company; even though a fake one, it's at least reliable. I can boot up the game wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted, and The Narrator will be there, ready to describe my every actions and predictably react to my every antics.

That's why I was so happy when I bought a Nintendo Switch. Finally I could play The Stanley Parable on-the-go, anywhere!

But it's worn thin. I've become bored. I can almost remember every dialogues, every possible scenarios the game can play out in. I could not help but notice the pretense that I'm in: I'm still playing the game alone with a computer program I'm pretending to be self-aware. And so I stopped playing video games by myself. I could not find any joy, or at least consolation, in it anymore.

Then I started to play games with friend on my Switch. I played Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, Stick Fight, Goose Game, and others. Playing with friends did bring me joy. I was happy in the company of the people I cared about. I was happy that I could bring them joy. I often let them win in the games we played, hoping that they would keep playing with me. I was not 100% secure, but I was contend enough with it.

But between two mountains is a valley. I fell even deeper into the pits of loneliness in between gaming sessions with friends. If anything, gaming with friends made me even more aware of my loneliness when I'm not gaming with them. My miserable love situation certainly didn't help.

I played a video game called The Beginner's Guide - from the writer of The Stanley Parable. I'm so happy that I've finally found the perfect argument for video games as a medium of art. This game is not like anything I've played before, and I doubt there will be anything like it. It's not something you play for fun, or to connect with friends. I connected deeply with the *creator* of this game instead. It's something you *play to feel*, and I consider a video game art when it manages to make me *feel something meaningful*.
